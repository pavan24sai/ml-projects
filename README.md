Exploring Machine Learning Concepts through Projects

## Projects Overview
1. [P01_Descriptive_Statistics](./P01_Descriptive_Statistics.ipynb) - 
	* Basics of Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib libraries.
	* Calculating metrics such as mean, median, variance, and standard deviation.
	* Drawing inferences from histograms, density plots, box plots etc.,.
2. [P02_California_Housing_Prediction](./P02_California_Housing_Prediction.ipynb) - 
	* Illustrates end-to-end Machine Learning project code flow for [California House Price Prediction](./artifacts/housing.csv) project.
	* Hands-on exercise with algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and grid search for fine tuning the models using sklearn library.
